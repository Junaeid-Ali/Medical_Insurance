# Medical_Insurance
This project is a machine learning web application that predicts medical insurance charges for individuals based on demographic and health-related factors. It uses a trained Random Forest Regressor model to estimate insurance costs, taking into account features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and residential region.
